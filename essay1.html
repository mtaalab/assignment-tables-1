			<div class="s"> Pollution means contamination of unwanted matters, that cause harm and discomfort to human and other organisms.Pollution is the greatest threat to humanity. There are different kinds of pollution like Air pollution, Water pollution and sound pollution. Reason of Air pollution is smoke of mills and factories. The sound and noise of loudspeakers, crackers, vehicles unnecessary loud horn etc causes sound pollution. The dirty waste chemical from factories cleaning of oil tankers causes water pollution.
We are very much concern about pollution. It is because pollution causes our health badly. It causes dreadful diseases like cancer, asthma and lever problems.
The government must impose and enforce laws to prevent pollution. Government also should reward the factories whichcontrols their waste and use technology to check pollution. Government also reward the Association which worksfor plantation. Cutting down trees must be strictly prohibitedif it is done without genuine certain reason. There must be implementation of punishing one who are not caring government rules and use microphone and loudspeakers beyond permissible limits. Above all public awareness is very much essential.

Pollution is the worst man made scenario. It causes millions of deaths through the world. pollution consist of many branches such as water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution etc. Today Delhi an Beijing are well known for its air quality which are in red alert position by this civilians living there are being affected by breathing disorders such as lung cancer , asthma etc.In the case of water pollution is still worse, people drinking polluted water can cause even death by 30's.Pollution must be controlled or else even our ozone layer will be gone for ever already we have a hole in the ozone over Antarctica and is still expanding due to our rapid production of CFC's.sustainable development is required to control pollution and minimize it . If we fail to do so, sooner or later mother nature will eliminate our civilization.

Environmental Pollution 
The things all around us are said to be our environment. It is a combination of land, water, air with the world of living beings and vegetations. There has been a wonderful balance in the environment created by Nature all down the ages, and this sustains life on earth. But man is the mostintelligent creature has tried to exploit Nature for his benefit. He has applied the inventive skill to make use of the resources in his own way. It has distributed the ecological balance leading to pollution. Our desire for using natural resources forour so-called progress and prosperity have made us destroy our environment causing great harm to our lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere We will certainly be in trouble in future. So, we should protect our environment at any cost.
